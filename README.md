Made for Global Game Jam 2025(24-26 January)

Bubble Rumble Mania 2025 is a fun, fast-paced arcade game where you control a player who must pop bubbles that spawn randomly on the screen. The objective is simple: click on the bubbles before time runs out! As the bubbles float upward, your score increases with every bubble you pop. The game features a countdown timer, and once the timer hits zero, it's game over! The player can then restart the game and try to beat their previous score.

The game was developed during the Global Game Jam 2025, with the theme centered around the word "Bubble." It combines elements of action and casual gameplay, making it perfect for a quick, engaging experience.
